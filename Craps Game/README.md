# Craps Game
This was a homework assignment for my web application development course. Completed October 30, 2019.

## Instructions
1. Set initial purse to $1000
2. Ask user for a bet amount
3. When the game begins, generate 2 random numbers to roll 2 dice
	- If you roll a 7 or 11 then win immediately
	- Otherwise, total dice is your "point"
4. If you did not win, roll dice until:
	- Roll the "point" - win
	- Roll a 2, 7, or 11 - lose
5. Add or deduct bet from initial purse
